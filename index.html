        Alright lets get this bread.  Plan of attack:
        Modify the 'game' function so that it doesn't play 5 times.  Instead
        display which round it is and what the score is on the page.  Let it 
        be a 'best of 7' series, so first person to 4 points wins.
        Once someone reaches 7 points, the page displays GAME OVER and who
        the winner is. and a new button appears to say PLAY AGAIN, which resets
        the game and brings back the original three buttons.

        So there will be a function within the rounds that tracks the 
        score.  Once someone reaches 4, it changes the giant header to GAME OVER
        and then changes the buttons to a single button that says
        play again.  Selecting play again resets the score and buttons.

        BOOM lets do it.

        <p><h4>Wed 9/27 710pm:</h4>
        Got the buttons working so that they initiate a round with that option.
        However now I need to rework the score tracking code.
        <b>BIG</b> fan of post work progress.  Only one or two meals worth of food left.
        BUT now I can go home and play video games and feel good about myself :)</p>
